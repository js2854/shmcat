Compile and install in the usual GNU way:
	cd SUBDIR
	./configure
	make
	su -c 'make install'

To dump a shared memory segment, given by key:
	shmcat -M KEY
	(where KEY is some shared memory key obtained via ipcs (1))

To dump a shared memory segment, given by id:
	shmcat -m ID
	(where ID is some shared memory ID obtained via ipcs (1))

You can dump several segments and files together with one call, e.g.:
	shmcat -m 1234 -f some_file

For more information type:
	shmcat -h
	(or see the man page)

If you dump shared memory segments, you would probably want to redirect the
output of shmcat to a file or a program like od (1), because shared memory
data usually has a binary form and thus it may contain non-printable
characters.
